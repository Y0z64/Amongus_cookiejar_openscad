# Amongus_cookiejar_openscad
![alt text](https://github.com/Y0z64/amongus_cookiejar_openscad/blob/master/assets/whole_model.png?raw=true)

Made this for a school project using openscad.
All the surfaces are based on parametrized equations translated (badly) into openscad

I recomend to manually set ```$fn=>100;``` before rendering/exporting for better resolution.

The model is meant to be able to be printed separatedly in two pieces and assembled aftewards.
