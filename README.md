Made this for a school project using openscad.
All the surfaces are based on parametrized equations translated (badly) into openscad

I recomend manually set ```$fn=>100;``` when rendering for better resolution, specially in the lid

The model is meant to be able to be printed separatedly in two pieces and assembled aftewards.
